## How To

### Expectations
We expect all prospective contributers to read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ossd-s25/Color1ze/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before making any contributions.

### Creating an Issue
If you've identified an oversight, bug, or new feature please make open an Issue on the [repo's issue page](https://github.com/ossd-s25/Color1ze/issues). Make sure the title is clear and concise and make sure the description has enough relevant details so that an interested contributer can easily get to work without needing to ask for significant clarification.

### Claiming an Issue
If you see an Issue you'd like to take a crack at, leave a comment saying that you'll take it on. This is a first-come-first-serve system, so if an Issue is claimed, you'll have to discuss with the claiming person if you'd like a chance. If it was been 2+ weeks since the claiming party committed any work and the claiming person isn't responding to messages, you may take over their responsibility. **You may claim your own issue as long as you still follow these contributing guidelines.**

### Making the Contributions
To get started on your contribution, fork the repo and create a branch with a title that corresponds to the title of the Issue. Additionally, make sure to link your fork to Issue itself. This goes without saying, but please thoroughly test your code before proceeding.

### Pull Requests
Once your work is done **and tested**, you make create a pull request. Make sure that the PR is linked to the Issue. **YOU MAY NOT MERGE YOUR OWN PULL REQUEST.**
